Assumptions:
-I assumed that the user would not enter in a string instead of integers thousands of times in a row

Bugs:
-If the user enters strings instead of integers enough times in a row (thousands at least) when asked for coordinates, a stack overflow error will eventually occur with the system stack in coordInput() in Main.java

Outside Sources:
-I used https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-ansi.html to find extra text colors for the numbers
-I used https://www.javatpoint.com/java-integer-parseint-method to find out information on Integer.parseInt() and error catching in order to make sure the user doesn't input Strings when asked for coords in coordInput()


I certify that the information contained in this README
file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course
policies in the ’Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course
syllabus.
